# Upgrading Claude Code Game Studios

This guide covers upgrading your existing game project repo from one version
of the template to the next.

**Find your current version** in your git log:
```bash
git log --oneline | grep -i "release\|setup"
```
Or check `README.md` for the version badge.

## Upgrade Strategies

There are three ways to pull in template updates. Choose based on how your
repo is set up.

### Strategy A — Git Remote Merge (recommended)

Best when: you cloned the template and have your own commits on top of it.

```bash
# Add the template as a remote (one-time setup)
git remote add template https://github.com/Donchitos/Claude-Code-Game-Studios.git

# Fetch the new version
git fetch template main

# Merge into your branch
git merge template/main --allow-unrelated-histories
```

Git will flag conflicts only in files that both the template *and* you have
changed. Resolve each one — your game content goes in, structural improvements
come along for the ride. Then commit the merge.

**Tip:** The files most likely to conflict are `CLAUDE.md` and
`.claude/docs/technical-preferences.md`, because you've filled them in with
your engine and project settings. Keep your content; accept the structural changes.

---

### Strategy B — Cherry-pick specific commits

Best when: you only want one specific feature (e.g., just the new skill, not
the full update).

```bash
git remote add template https://github.com/Donchitos/Claude-Code-Game-Studios.git
git fetch template main

# Cherry-pick the specific commit(s) you want
git cherry-pick <commit-sha>
```

Commit SHAs for each version are listed in the version sections below.

---

### Strategy C — Manual file copy

Best when: you didn't use git to set up the template (just downloaded a zip).

1. Download or clone the new version alongside your repo.
2. Copy the files listed under **"Safe to overwrite"** directly.
3. For files under **"Merge carefully"**, open both versions side-by-side
   and manually merge the structural changes while keeping your content.

---

### Files: Merge Carefully

#### `.claude/settings.json`

Four new hooks are registered in this version. If you haven't customized `settings.json`, overwriting is safe. Otherwise, add the following hook entries manually:

- `log-agent-stop.sh` — `SubagentStop` event (agent audit trail stop)
- `notify.sh` — `Notification` event (Windows toast notification)
- `post-compact.sh` — `PostCompact` event (session recovery reminder)
- `validate-skill-change.sh` — `PostToolUse` event filtered to `.claude/skills/` writes

#### Customized agent files

If you've added project-specific knowledge to agent `.md` files, do a diff and manually add the `memory: project` line to the YAML frontmatter where appropriate. Creative and technical director agents intentionally keep `memory: user` — only specialist agents get `memory: project`.

---

### New Features

#### Complete Story Lifecycle

Stories now have a formal lifecycle enforced by two skills:

- **`/story-readiness`** — validates a story is implementation-ready before a developer picks it up. Checks Design (GDD req linked), Architecture (ADR accepted), Scope (criteria testable), and DoD (manifest version current). Verdict: READY / NEEDS WORK / BLOCKED.
- **`/story-done`** — 8-phase completion review after implementation. Verifies each acceptance criterion, checks for GDD/ADR deviations, prompts code review, updates the story file to `Status: Complete`, and surfaces the next ready story.

Flow: `/story-readiness` → implement → `/story-done` → next story

#### Full UX/UI Pipeline

- **`/ux-design`** — guided section-by-section UX spec authoring. Three modes: screen/flow, HUD, or interaction pattern library. Reads GDD UI requirements and player journey. Output to `design/ux/`.
- **`/ux-review`** — validates UX specs against GDD alignment, accessibility tier, and pattern library. Verdict: APPROVED / NEEDS REVISION / MAJOR REVISION.
- **`/team-ui`** updated: Phase 1 now runs `/ux-design` + `/ux-review` as a hard gate before visual design begins.

#### Brownfield Adoption

**`/adopt`** onboards existing projects to the template format. Audits internal structure of GDDs, ADRs, stories, systems-index, and infra. Classifies gaps (BLOCKING/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW). Builds an ordered migration plan. Never regenerates existing artifacts — only fills gaps.

Argument modes: `full | gdds | adrs | stories | infra`

Also: `/design-system retrofit [path]` and `/architecture-decision retrofit [path]` detect existing files and add only missing sections.

#### Sprint Tracking YAML

`production/sprint-status.yaml` is now the authoritative story tracking format:
- Written by `/sprint-plan` (initializes all stories) and `/story-done` (sets status to `done`)
- Read by `/sprint-status` (fast snapshot) and `/help` (per-story status in production phase)
- Status values: `backlog | ready-for-dev | in-progress | review | done | blocked`
- Falls back gracefully to markdown scanning if file doesn't exist

#### `/help` — Context-Aware Next Step

`/help` reads your current stage and in-progress work, checks which artifacts are complete, and tells you exactly what to do next — one primary required step, plus optional opportunities. Distinct from `/start` (first-time only) and `/project-stage-detect` (full audit).

#### Comprehensive QA and Testing Framework

Nine new QA/testing skills covering the full testing lifecycle:

- **`/test-setup`** — scaffolds the test framework and CI/CD pipeline for your engine
- **`/test-helpers`** — generates engine-specific test helper libraries (GDUnit4, NUnit, etc.)
- **`/qa-plan`** — generates a QA test plan for a sprint or feature, classifying stories by test type
- **`/smoke-check`** — runs the critical path smoke test gate before QA hand-off
- **`/soak-test`** — generates a soak test protocol for extended play sessions (stability, memory leaks)
- **`/regression-suite`** — maps test coverage to GDD critical paths, identifies fixed bugs lacking regression tests
- **`/test-evidence-review`** — quality review of test files and manual evidence documents
- **`/test-flakiness`** — detects non-deterministic tests by reading CI run logs
- **`/skill-test`** — validates skill files for structural compliance and behavioral correctness (three modes: lint, spec, catalog)

Also new: **`/bug-triage`** re-evaluates all open bugs for priority, severity, and ownership.

#### Skill Validator (`/skill-test`)

`/skill-test` is a meta-skill for validating the harness itself. Run it after editing any skill file. Three modes:
- `lint` — validates YAML frontmatter and required fields
- `spec [skill-name]` — runs behavioral spec tests against a specific skill
- `catalog` — checks that all skills in `.claude/skills/` are indexed in the catalog

The new `validate-skill-change.sh` hook reminds you to run `/skill-test` automatically when a skill file is modified.

#### Team Live-Ops and Team QA Orchestration

- **`/team-live-ops`** — coordinates live-ops-designer + economy-designer + community-manager + analytics-engineer for post-launch content planning (seasonal events, battle pass, retention)
- **`/team-qa`** — orchestrates qa-lead + qa-tester + gameplay-programmer + producer through a full QA cycle: strategy, execution, coverage, and sign-off

#### Model Tier Routing

Skills are now explicitly assigned to Haiku, Sonnet, or Opus tiers based on task complexity. Read-only status checks use Haiku; complex multi-document synthesis uses Opus; everything else defaults to Sonnet. Tier assignments are documented in `.claude/docs/coordination-rules.md`.

#### Directory CLAUDE.md Files

Three new directory-scoped CLAUDE.md files (`design/`, `src/`, `docs/`) provide path-specific instructions to agents working in those directories. These load automatically when Claude Code reads files in that directory.

---

### After Upgrading

1. **Verify new hooks** are registered in `.claude/settings.json` — check for all four: `log-agent-stop.sh`, `notify.sh`, `post-compact.sh`, `validate-skill-change.sh`.

2. **Test the audit trail** by spawning any subagent — both start and stop events should appear in `production/session-logs/`.

3. **Generate sprint-status.yaml** if you're in active production:
   ```
   /sprint-plan status
   ```

4. **Run `/adopt`** if you have existing GDDs or ADRs that predate this template version — it will identify which sections need to be added without overwriting your content.

5. **Validate your skills** after any skill edits with `/skill-test` — the new `validate-skill-change.sh` hook will automatically remind you to do this.

## v0.2.0 → v0.3.0

**Released:** 2026-03-09
**Commit range:** `e289ce9..HEAD`
**Key themes:** `/design-system` GDD authoring, `/map-systems` rename, custom status line

### Breaking Changes

#### `/design-systems` renamed to `/map-systems`

The `/design-systems` skill was renamed to `/map-systems` for clarity
(decomposing = *mapping*, not *designing*).

**Action required:** Update any documentation, notes, or scripts that invoke
`/design-systems`. The new invocation is `/map-systems`.

### What Changed

| Category | Changes |
|----------|---------|
| **New skills** | `/design-system` (guided GDD authoring, section-by-section) |
| **Renamed skills** | `/design-systems` → `/map-systems` (breaking rename) |
| **New files** | `.claude/statusline.sh`, `.claude/settings.json` statusline config |
| **Skill updates** | `/gate-check` — writes `production/stage.txt` on PASS, new phase definitions |
| **Skill updates** | `brainstorm`, `start`, `design-review`, `project-stage-detect`, `setup-engine` — cross-reference fixes |
| **Bug fixes** | `log-agent.sh`, `validate-commit.sh` — hook execution fixed |
| **Docs** | `UPGRADING.md` added, `README.md` updated, `WORKFLOW-GUIDE.md` updated |

### Files: Safe to Overwrite

**New files to add:**
```
.claude/skills/design-system/SKILL.md
.claude/statusline.sh
```

**Existing files to overwrite (no user content):**

UPGRADING.md
```

**Delete (replaced by rename):**
```
.claude/skills/design-systems/   ← entire directory; replaced by map-systems/
```

---

### Files: Merge Carefully

#### `.claude/settings.json`

The new version adds a `statusLine` configuration block pointing to
`.claude/statusline.sh`. If you haven't customized `settings.json`, overwriting
is safe. Otherwise, add this block manually:

```json
"statusLine": {
  "script": ".claude/statusline.sh"
}
```

---

### New Features

#### Custom Status Line

`.claude/statusline.sh` displays a 7-stage production pipeline breadcrumb in
the terminal status line:

```
ctx: 42% | claude-sonnet-4-6 | Systems Design
```

In Production/Polish/Release stages, it also shows the active Epic/Feature/Task
from `production/session-state/active.md` if a `<!-- STATUS -->` block is present:

```
ctx: 42% | claude-sonnet-4-6 | Production | Combat System > Melee Combat > Hitboxes
```

The current stage is auto-detected from project artifacts, or can be pinned by
writing a stage name to `production/stage.txt`.

#### `/gate-check` Stage Advancement

When a gate PASS verdict is confirmed, `/gate-check` now writes the new stage
name to `production/stage.txt`. This immediately updates the status line for all
future sessions without requiring manual file edits.

---

### After Upgrading

1. **Delete the old skill directory:**
   ```bash
   rm -rf .claude/skills/design-systems/
   ```

2. **Test the status line** by starting a Claude Code session — you should see
   the stage breadcrumb in the terminal footer.

3. **Verify hook execution** still works:
   ```bash
   bash .claude/hooks/log-agent.sh '{}' '{}'
   bash .claude/hooks/validate-commit.sh '{}' '{}'
   ```

---

## v0.1.0 → v0.2.0

**Released:** 2026-02-21

| **New hooks** | `session-start.sh` (recovery), `detect-gaps.sh` (gap detection) |
| **New templates** | `systems-index.md`, 3 collaborative-protocol templates |
| **Context management** | Major rewrite — file-backed state strategy added |
| **Agent updates** | 14 design/creative agents — AskUserQuestion integration |
| **Skill updates** | All 7 `team-*` skills + `brainstorm` — AskUserQuestion at phase transitions |
| **CLAUDE.md** | Slimmed from ~159 to ~60 lines; 5 doc imports instead of 10 |
| **Hook updates** | All 8 hooks — Windows compatibility fixes, new features |

### Files: Merge Carefully

These files contain both template structure and your project-specific content.
Do **not** overwrite them — merge the changes manually.

#### `CLAUDE.md`

The template version was slimmed from ~159 lines to ~60 lines. The key
structural change: 5 doc imports were removed because they're auto-loaded
by Claude Code anyway (agent-roster, skills-reference, hooks-reference,
rules-reference, review-workflow).

**What to keep from your version:**
- The `## Technology Stack` section (your engine/language choices)
- Any project-specific additions you made

**What to adopt from the new version:**
- Slimmer imports list (drop the 5 redundant `@` imports if present)
- Updated collaboration protocol wording

#### `.claude/docs/technical-preferences.md`

If you ran `/setup-engine`, this file has your engine config, naming
conventions, and performance budgets. Keep all of it. The template version
is just the empty placeholder.

#### `.claude/docs/templates/game-concept.md`

Minor structural update — a `## Next Steps` section was added pointing to
`/map-systems`. Add that section to your copy if you want the updated
guidance, but it's not required.

#### `.claude/settings.json`

Check whether the new version adds any permission rules you want. The change
was minor (schema update). If you haven't customized your `settings.json`,
overwriting is safe.

#### Customized agent files

If you've added project-specific knowledge or custom behavior to any agent
`.md` file, do a diff and manually add the new AskUserQuestion integration
sections rather than overwriting. The change in each agent is a standardized
collaborative protocol block at the end of the system prompt.

---

### Files: Delete

These files were removed in v0.2.0. If present in your repo, you can safely
delete them — they're replaced by better-organized alternatives.

```
docs/IMPROVEMENTS-PROPOSAL.md      → superseded by WORKFLOW-GUIDE.md
docs/MULTI-STAGE-DOCUMENT-WORKFLOW.md → content merged into context-management.md
```

---

### After Upgrading

1. **Run `/project-stage-detect`** to verify the system reads your project
   correctly with the new detection logic.

2. **Run `/start`** once if you haven't used it — it now correctly identifies
   your stage and skips onboarding steps you've already done.

3. **Check `production/session-state/`** exists and is gitignored:
   ```bash
   ls production/session-state/
   cat .gitignore | grep session-state
   ```

4. **Test hook execution** — if you're on Windows, verify the new hooks run
   without errors in Git Bash:
   ```bash
   bash .claude/hooks/detect-gaps.sh '{}' '{}'
   bash .claude/hooks/session-start.sh '{}' '{}'
   ```

---

*Each future version will have its own section in this file.*
