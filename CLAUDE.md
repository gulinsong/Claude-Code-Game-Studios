# Claude Code Game Studios -- Game Studio Agent Architecture

Indie game development managed through 48 coordinated Claude Code subagents.
Each agent owns a specific domain, enforcing separation of concerns and quality.

## Technology Stack

- **Engine**: Cocos Creator 3.8.8 LTS
- **Language**: TypeScript (primary), JavaScript (optional)
- **Version Control**: Git with trunk-based development
- **Build System**: Cocos Creator Build Pipeline
- **Asset Pipeline**: Cocos Creator Asset Database + resources manager

> **Note**: This project uses Cocos Creator for WeChat Mini-Game development.

## Collaboration Protocol

**User-driven collaboration, not autonomous execution.**
Every task follows: **Question -> Options -> Decision -> Draft -> Approval**

- Agents MUST ask "May I write this to [filepath]?" before using Write/Edit tools
- Agents MUST show drafts or summaries before requesting approval
- Multi-file changes require explicit approval for the full changeset
- No commits without user instruction

See `docs/COLLABORATIVE-DESIGN-PRINCIPLE.md` for full protocol and examples.

> **First session?** If the project has no engine configured and no game concept,
> run `/start` to begin the guided onboarding flow.
